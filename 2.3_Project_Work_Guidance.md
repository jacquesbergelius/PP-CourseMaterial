# Instructions for project work

## Introduction and objectives

This guideline serves as the Terms of Reference for the Simulation Project.

It aims to deepen your knowledge of the Java programming language, in particular with respect to the topics covered in the course "Applications and Databases", and to gain an understanding of the problem theory of simulation.

The work can be carried out in groups of three or four.

## Definition phase

The project starts with the definition phase, which describes the system to be developed.

In the definition phase, the vision and conceptual model of the product are decided.

The output of the definition phase is the first version of the project document, comprising chapters 1 to 4 (Introduction, Vision, Concepts and Definitions, Conceptual Model). This version corresponds to the definition document mentioned in the course description.
- The starting point for the definition is the requirements for the simulator (see below).
- The project document base in the course workspace is used to generate the project document.

## Requirements for the simulator

The project work will implement a simulator that meets all of the following requirements:
1. The conceptual model has at least 4 different service points.
2. It must be possible to change (at least partially) the distributions or their parameters as inputs to the model.
3. The simulator has a graphical (JavaFX) user interface (for inputs and outputs).
4. The simulation run can be visualised or animated.
The program makes use of external data repositories (can be a file or database solution).
6. Once started, the simulator operates autonomously, but its operation can be influenced while the program is running, e.g. by slowing down, speeding up, stepping, etc. in visualisation/animation mode.
7.	The software interface must be suitable for general use (fonts, colours, etc.) and easy to use for the casual user.
      
The implementation of all kinds of variability adds value to the work.

## Implementation and testing phase

The group divides the programming tasks so that everyone has something meaningful to do.

The code should be tested continuously. Once you have made a small piece of code, you should make sure that it works as intended. If you wish, you can write JUnit tests (there should be enough in the final version to show that the idea has been learned).

Make commits to working versions often enough.

Produce a Javadoc documentation of the software, describing the classes in the model part and all methods and attributes (including private ones) of the classes.

## Evaluation

**The evaluation of the specification document (20% of the total evaluation)** is based on the thoroughness and care taken in the preparation of the specification document.

**Definition document max 20 p.**
Thoroughness/coverage/scope 10 points.
Carefulness (structuring, spelling, figure references, etc.) 10 p

**The evaluation of the project work (60% of the total evaluation)** will be based on the characteristics of the software, its complexity, its versatility (modelling of variability), its quality (coding practices) and, on the other hand, the quality and completeness of the documentation. The documentation also includes the Java doc.

**Software max 30 p:**
Complexity, scope, quality max 15 p.
User interface max 5 p.
Visualisation/animation max 5 p.
Data repositories max 5 p.
JUnit tests must be present, absence -3 p.

**Documentation max 30 p:**
Software description max 15 p.
Experiment descriptions max 5 p.
User manual max 5 p
Javadoc max 5 p.

Assessment will take into account the size of the group. The more factors, the more is required.

Self- and peer-assessments will also be taken into account in the final evaluations.
