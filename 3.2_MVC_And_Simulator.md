# MVC Design Pattern

In software engineering, a (software) [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

MVC, which stands for [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), is a popular design pattern used in software development to structure an application in a way that separates its concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain. In Java programming, MVC is widely utilized to organize the codebase effectively and achieve a clean and modular design. Let's delve into a brief introduction to MVC in the context of Java programming:

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern in Java

**1. Model (M):**
- The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the application's state and behavior, ensuring that it remains independent of the user interface (View) and the user interactions (Controller).
- In a Java application, the Model is often implemented using classes that handle data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

**2. View (V):**
- The View is responsible for presenting the data from the Model to the user and collecting user input. It displays the information and communicates any user actions back to the Controller.
- In Java, the View is typically implemented using GUI components like Swing or JavaFX, which present the data in a user-friendly interface.

**3. Controller (C):**
- The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, and updates the Model accordingly. It also updates the View based on changes in the Model.
- In Java, the Controller is implemented as a Java class that manages the application's flow, processes user input, and updates the Model and View accordingly.

### How MVC Works in Java:

Sometimes the MVC module relations are drawn in a different way to stress the separations of the View and the Model entities.

    model[MODEL<br>Data Logic]
    view[VIEW<br>Represent current model state]
    controller[CONTROLLER<br>Controls and decides how data is displayed]
    
    controller -->|modifies| model
    controller -.->|pulls data<br>via getters| model
    controller -->|sets data<br>via setters| model
    controller -->|initiates| view
    view -.->|pulls data<br>via getters| controller
    view -->|updates data<br>via setters and event handlers| controller
```

1. **User Interaction:**
    - A user interacts with the application through the View, initiating actions like button clicks or data input.

2. **View Notifies Controller:**
    - The View notifies the Controller of these user actions, providing necessary information.

3. **Controller Processes Input:**
    - The Controller receives the input, processes it, and decides how to handle the action.

4. **Controller Updates Model:**
    - The Controller interacts with the Model, updating its state or requesting data based on the user action.

If the View and Model are tightly coupled, it is possible to have these additional dependencies:

5. **Model Notifies View:**
    - The Model notifies the View of any changes in its state.

6. **View Fetches Updated Data:**
    - The View fetches the updated data from the Model and updates its display accordingly.

By following this pattern, the application's code is structured in a way that separates concerns, making it easier to maintain, extend, and collaborate on. The Model remains independent, the View is responsible for the user interface, and the Controller manages the interactions and flow of the application. This separation enhances code reusability and scalability in Java programming, e.g., it is fairly simple to change the application to a different platformâ€”only the View needs to be rewritten.


## A MVC Example

Let's create a simple Java example using the MVC pattern for a basic application that calculates the square of a number. We'll have three main components: Model, View, and Controller.

### Model:
```java
// Model.java
public class Model {
    private int number;

    public void setNumber(int number) {
        this.number = number;
    }

    public int getSquare() {
        return number * number;
    }
}
```

### View:
```java
// View.java
public class View {
    public void displaySquare(int number, int square) {
        System.out.println("Square of " + number + " is: " + square);
    }

    public int getUserInput() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        return scanner.nextInt();
    }
}
```

### Controller:
```java
// Controller.java
public class Controller {
    private Model model;
    private View view;

    public Controller(Model model, View view) {
        this.model = model;
        this.view = view;
    }

    public void calculateSquare() {
        int number = view.getUserInput();
        model.setNumber(number);

        int square = model.getSquare();
        view.displaySquare(number, square);
    }
}
```

### Main Application:
```java
// MainApp.java
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Model model = new Model();
        View view = new View();
        Controller controller = new Controller(model, view);

        controller.calculateSquare();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a Model that represents the data and business logic (calculating the square). The View displays the input prompt and the result, while the Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, managing the application flow.

When you run `MainApp`, it will ask the user to input a number, calculate the square using the Model, and display the result using the View. This structure adheres to the MVC pattern, keeping concerns separated and promoting a clean and modular design.

# Logical structure of the simulation system

```mermaid
flowchart BT
    subgraph "Visualization"
       subgraph "View"
           ui["User Interface (UI)"]    
       end
           
       controller[Controller]    
    end
    
    subgraph "Model"
        engine[Engine]
        arrivalProcess[Arrival Process]
        event[Event]
        customer[Customer]
    end
    
    ui --> controller
    controller --> ui
    
    controller --> engine
    engine --> controller
    
    engine --- arrivalProcess
    arrivalProcess --- event
    engine --- event
    event --- customer
    customer --- engine
```

The `Engine` is the *facade* of the `model` to the `controller`.

## MVC View in the simulator

`View` is a user interface (UI) where all inputs (e.g., simulation time, parameters of distributions, etc.) are provided. It has an additional animation/visualisation window where you can follow the progress of the simulation. Implemented as a separate class. There is also another window where the simulation results are presented.

You should also consider reading input data from a file and writing output data to a file/database.

## MVC Model in the simulator

The `Model` contains everything that has so far been written as the simulator's machinery.

The main class of the model that is visible from the outside (facade) is the `Engine`, which must be implemented as a separate thread so that the user interface does not get stuck while the simulation is running. Each new simulation run creates a new Engine thread. The Engine creates all the machinery it needs.

## Interfaces in the simulator

Interface definitions for View, Controller and Model help to see what the different layers offer each other.
