# Time-Slice Simulator in Java

It is quite easy to implement time-slice simulator in Java. The current time-slice being processed can be kept in a variable `t`, and we should have a loop where this time is updated. Time delays (time between phone call/customer arrivals and operator service times) can be implemented using counter variables.

```Java
int arrival = 3;

// main simulation loop, t represent the number of the current time-slice
for (int t = 0; t <= 24; t++) {
    System.out.print("Time "+t +"min: ");
    if (arrival == 0) {
        // new call has arrived
        System.out.print("New call #"+call +" received ");
        arrival = 3;

        // do here what you need to do with the call just arrived
        .
        .
        .
    }

    // update time delay counters
    arrival--; System.out.println("");
}
```

Main `for`-loop simulates processing successive time-slices. This time-slice can represent units in the real world to be simulated, e.g., one minute. `arrival` is a counter in this loop to count the time between phone calls entering to the system.

## Traditional implementation

The previous concept for the time-slice simulator can be extended easily to implement the given telephone call center example. Operator service times are implemented using time counters `operator1` and `operator2`. Some logic is also needed to dispatch the received call to the first available operator.

```Java
public class TSSimulator {
    private static final int ARRIVALRATE = 3;               // time between call arrivals
    private static final int OPERATORPROCESSINGTIME = 5;    // time spent in servicing the customer

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arrival = ARRIVALRATE;
        int operator1 = 0, operator2 = 0;
        boolean operator1Running = false, operator2Running = false;

        int call = 1, op1call = 0, op2call = 0;

        // main simulation loop, t represent the number of the current time-slice
        for (int t = 0; t <= 24; t++) {
            System.out.print("Time " + t + "min: ");
            if (arrival == 0) {
                // new call has arrived
                System.out.print("New call #" + call + " received ");
                arrival = ARRIVALRATE;

                // check which operator is free to serve the current call
                if (!operator1Running) {
                    System.out.print("Operator 1 service starts ");
                    op1call = call;
                    operator1Running = true; operator1 = OPERATORPROCESSINGTIME;
                } else if (!operator2Running) {
                    System.out.print("Operator 2 service starts ");
                    op2call = call;
                    operator2Running = true; operator2 = OPERATORPROCESSINGTIME;
                } else {
                    System.out.print("***System is too busy***");
                }
                call++;
            }

            // check whether operators have done their services
            if (operator1Running && operator1 == 0) {
                System.out.print("Call #" + op1call + " serviced (operator1)");
                operator1Running = false;
            }
            if (operator2Running && operator2 == 0) {
                System.out.print("Call #" + op2call + " serviced (operator2)");
                operator2Running = false;
            }

            // update time delay counters
            arrival--; operator1--; operator2--; System.out.println("");
        }
    }
}
```

## Object-oriented implementation

The previous simulator should have been implemented using a class for the operator. In this way, we can implement only one operator and then instantiate the class to create two operator objects.

When designing the call for the operator, we first concentrate what the operator should do, e.g., what are the methods in the operator class. We need the following methods:
  - `start`, a method to inform the operator that the call has received
  - `isBusy`, a method to inform call dispatcher whether the operator is busy servicing a call
  - `run`, a method to inform that one time-slice has been elapsed

After we know the methods, we start implementing them and during that implementation we will find what instance variables we will need. In this way we find that the variables `operator`, `callId`, `timer` and `running` are needed.
```Java
public class Operator {
    private static final int OPERATORPROCESSINGTIME = 5;    // time spent in servicing the customer

    private String operator;
    private int callId;
    private int timer;
    private boolean running;

    public Operator(String operatorName) {
        operator = operatorName;
        running = false;
    }

    /* start servicing the given call */
    public void start(int call) {
        System.out.print(operator + " service starts ");
        callId = call;
        timer = OPERATORPROCESSINGTIME + 1;
        running = true;
    }

    /* check whether the operator is busy servicing a call */
    public boolean isBusy() {
        return running;
    }

    /* advance one time-slice forward */
    public void run() {
        if (running) {
            timer--;
            if (timer <= 0) {
                running = false;
                System.out.print("Call #" + callId + " served (" + operator + ")");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When we have the operator class ready, the main simulator function can be converted from the previous version quite easily.
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList;

/*
 * A simple time-slice simulator for phone calls arriving and two operators
 *  Phone call arrival times and operator service times are constant
 *  Time slice used is 1 minute
 */
public class TimeSliceSimu {
    private static final int ARRIVALRATE = 3;   // time between call arrivals
    private static final int OPERATORS = 2;     // number of operators

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arrival = ARRIVALRATE;
        int call = 1;

        // create operators
        ArrayList<Operator> operators = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < OPERATORS; i++) {
            String opName = "Operator " + i;
            operators.add(new Operator(opName));
        }

        // main simulation loop, t represent the number of the current time-slice
        for (int t = 0; t <= 24; t++) {
            System.out.print("Time " + t + "min: ");
            if (arrival == 0) {
                // new call has arrived
                System.out.print("New call #" + call + " received ");
                arrival = ARRIVALRATE;

                // give the call to the first available operator
                boolean serviced = false;
                for (Operator op : operators) {
                    if (!op.isBusy()) {
                        op.start(call);
                        serviced = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!serviced)  // if no operator was able to accept the call
                    System.out.print("***System is too busy***");
                call++;
            }

            // update the time (one time-slice has elapsed)
            arrival--;
            for (Operator op : operators)
                op.run();
            System.out.println("");
        }
    }
}
```

Using the `Operator` class it is quite easy to add many operators to the simulator. Therefore, we have used Java collections `ArrayList` for storing operator objects. In this way, we can create so many operators to the simulator that is needed.
